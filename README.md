# ForzaStats

ForzaStats is an app to show statistics coming from Forza Horizon 4 telemetry data.

It is built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org/) and uses [Material.io](https://material.io/) to provide a nice UI compliant to Material Design standards.

It will calculate things like time from 0 to 100 km/h and it will show charts about speed, power and more!

Feel free to contribute, share and (most importantly!) use it!
