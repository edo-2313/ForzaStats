# ForzaStats

ForzaStats is an app built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org/) to show statistics coming from Forza Horizon 4 telemetry data.

It will calculate things like time from 0 to 100 km/h and it will show charts about speed, power and more!

Feel free to contribute, share and (most importantly!) use it!
